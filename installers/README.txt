Place the official MindVision Camera SDK installer here.

Required filename: MindVision_SDK_Setup.exe

This file is bundled into the MagicQC installer and chain-run during installation
if the MindVision SDK is not already present on the user's machine.

How to obtain:
  - Contact MindVision Technology or your camera hardware supplier
  - Download from the MindVision official website
  - Or extract from the CD/USB that shipped with the camera

The installer registers MVCAMSDK_X64.dll in the system PATH, which is required
for the camera measurement features to work.
